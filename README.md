README BEFORE USE:

The website is currently working online at https://vegeplanner.netlify.app/ . If you want to test it on your local device, download it and access the "getUrl.js" file in the "components" folder.

Locate: let apiKey = &apiKey=${process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY};

Edit this to: let apiKey = "&apiKey=YourPersonalApiKey";

You're going to need also node_modules which are not included in this repository.

Then use the console in "vegeplanner-main" directory and the "npm start" command.
